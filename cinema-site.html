    <h2>A personal cinema scheduler</h2>

    <p>This site was written in collaboration with <span lang=is>Kristrún
    Skúladóttir</span> and <span lang=is>Guðrún Þóra Sigurðardóttir</span>
    as a final project in a web programming course at the University of
    Iceland in the fall of 2014. We wanted to make a website where users
    could get an overview of all movies currently showing in Icelandic
    cinemas, where they were shown and at what time. The users can filter
    by cinemas and add movies to their "My movies" list.</p>
    
    <p>We decided upon using the Django framwork with some added JavaScript
    frontend functionality. The site is hosted on a Raspberry Pi model B
    single-board computer and because of its limited hardware the site can
    seem quite slow, especially when the backend is caching data to the
    SQLite database.</p>
