*My personal and professional website*

### Updating the site
Most of the files are static HTML and won't be changed often. I do however update my CV from time to time and at the same time I update the date in the footer of the front page to indicate the change to the site.

After updating `cv.tex` simply running `make` generates both the CV's PDF files and updates the date in `index.html`. I only have to make sure committing all the changed files to the repo.
