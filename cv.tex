{Iceland}{} {Spent the year 2017-18 at \emph{Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam} in the
Netherlands taking courses on distributed systems, concurrency algorithms, coding 
theory and cryptography. RU courses on topics such as machine learning, deep 
neural networks and combinatorics. Doing thesis work on computer proofs and 
conjectures about combinatorial objects and enumerations.}

{\textit{8,55} (out of 10)} {Specialization in Computer Science. Elective courses
in subjects such as algorithms, probability theory, combinatorics and graph theory.
President of the student union Stigull during the school year 2013-14. Wrote a
thesis named \emph{Occurrence graphs of patterns in permutations} (available from
\url{http://hdl.handle.net/1946/22017}).}

%~ for excellent results in Mathematics at graduation. Voted class councillor
%~ in final year.}

%~ \section{Bachelor thesis}
%~ \cvitem{title}{Occurrence graphs of patterns in permutations}
%~ \cvitem{supervisor}{Henning Ulfarsson, postdoctoral researcher at Reykjavik University}
%~ \cvitem{abstract}{This paper is based on a generalization of the
%~ idea behind the proof of the \emph{Simultaneous Shading Lemma} by
%~ Claesson et al.\@ (2014). We define the \emph{occurrence graph}
%~ $G_p(\pi)$ of a pattern $p$ in a permutation $\pi$ as the graph with
%~ the occurrences of $p$ in $\pi$ as vertices and edges between the
%~ vertices if the occurrences differ by exactly one element. We study
%~ the general properties of the occurrence graphs and some interesting
%~ extreme cases. The main theorem in this paper is that every \emph
%~ {hereditary property} of graphs produces a \emph{permutation class}.}

\section{Work experience}
\cventry{2015 -- 2018}{Software Developer}{WuXi NextCODE}{Reykjavik}{Iceland}
{Joined the company at an early stage when it was expanding very fast.
Started off in DevOps like assignments of maintaining, executing and
further developing deployment (Chef, Ansible) and infrastructure (AWS
CloudFormation, Terraform) code. Handed it over to a newly created Backend
Group and joined the Data Group. Developed Python code to import and process
genomic data in our system and integrating 3rd party platforms with ours.
Built, tested and deployed components in CI/CD loops using tools such as
Jenkins, Docker and Ansible. Returned for the summer of 2018 to create a
benchmarking suite for the company's core software which runs in a CI loop to
detect performance regression.}
%~ \cventry{Summer 2015}{Software Developer}{Handpoint}{Kopavogur}{Iceland}
%~ {Implementing protocols with partners and developing card reader software. 
%~ Didn't like it and quit.}
\cventry{Summer 2014}{Software Developer}{Invector}{Reykjavik}{Iceland}
{Developing a web app for clients using Invector's statistical model to estimate 
prices of real estates worldwide. Working primarily on designing the database, 
the user system and other backend programming.}
\cventry{Summer 2013}{Software Developer}{Reykjavik Energy}{Reykjavik}{Iceland}
{Brought in to program an interactive educational game about Reykjavik Energy's
CarbFix project. Worked with three Master's students who designed the game and
wrote the educational material. Coded the game in raw JavaScript using images
and graphics drawn and provided by them.}
%~ \cventry{Summer 2013}{Web programming}{Reconesse}{Reykjavik}{}
%~ {Together with two other university students we developed an
%~ interactive educational game about interesting female role models in
%~ women's right history for their website. The project received a
%~ grant from Rannís' Icelandic Student Innovation Fund.}

\section{Teaching}

\section{Interests}
\cvitem{tech}{Recent hands-on hobby projects include autonomous
    Raspberry Pis hosting websites and recording timelapses. Set
    up \url{blog.bjk.is} to document some of it. Manage my own VPS
    hosting websites and experimenting with various webservices.}
\cvitem{math}{I am deeply intrigued by the concept of infinity
    and I take joy in intuitive proofs by contradiction. During 
    junior college I participated in multiple mathematic competitions
    and twice I was selected to compete with the national team in 
    Baltic Way.}
\cvitem{chess}{For many years I studied chess and I achieved a peak 
    ELO rating of 2062. In 2007 I became national champion U20 and 
    in 2009 I played in the World Youth Chess Championship held in 
    Antalya, Turkey. Twice I became Nordic champion and three times 
    national champion with my junior college chess team. I have 
    tought chess in various elementary schools and organized my own 
    summer chess workshops.}
\cvitem{sports}{I like to lift weights, play football and bike to 
    keep me in shape and in good health. I also bike to commute. In 
    the summer of 2012 my friend and I went on a 2 month biking tour 
    through Europe, visiting six countries and bicycling over 1600 km.}
