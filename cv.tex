%~ \section{Master thesis}
%~ \cvitem{title}{Searching for combinatorial covers using integer linear programming}
%~ \cvitem{supervisor}{Henning A. Ulfarsson, Assistant Professor at Reykjavik University \newline Christian Bean, Postdoctoral Researcher at Reykjavik University}
%~ \cvitem{abstract}{We introduce the \textsf{CombCov} framework which 
%~ is a generalization of the \textsf{Struct} algorithm introduced by 
%~ Bean, Gudmundsson, and Ulfarsson in 
%~ \emph{``Automatic discovery of structural rules of permutation classes''}. 
%~ We give a simple example of an application of the framework to 
%~ \emph{avoidance sets} of \emph{words} and discuss in detail how to 
%~ generate \emph{rules} of lesser complexity and how a cover is verified 
%~ up to a certain size using integer linear programming. We then apply the
%~ framework to various published results on \emph{permutations} avoiding 
%~ \emph{mesh patterns} and try to find covers of similar problems with 
%~ some success. We show that \textsf{CombCov} is a powerful tool in 
%~ guiding humans by coming up with conjectures that would otherwise 
%~ have required substantial effort to discover manually.}

%~ \section{Bachelor thesis}
%~ \cvitem{title}{Occurrence graphs of patterns in permutations}
%~ \cvitem{supervisor}{Henning A. Ulfarsson, Postdoctoral Researcher at Reykjavik University}
%~ \cvitem{abstract}{This paper is based on a generalization of the
%~ idea behind the proof of the \emph{Simultaneous Shading Lemma} by
%~ Claesson et al.\@ (2014). We define the \emph{occurrence graph}
%~ $G_p(\pi)$ of a pattern $p$ in a permutation $\pi$ as the graph with
%~ the occurrences of $p$ in $\pi$ as vertices and edges between the
%~ vertices if the occurrences differ by exactly one element. We study
%~ the general properties of the occurrence graphs and some interesting
%~ extreme cases. The main theorem in this paper is that every \emph
%~ {hereditary property} of graphs produces a \emph{permutation class}.}

\section{Interests}
\cvitem{family}{As a father of one, much of my free time is devoted
    to my family. If it isn't time spent on the playground with my son
    or at home playing cards with my partner, I might be cleaning the
    floor around the baby chair or washing his clothes.}
\cvitem{sports}{I love all kinds of sports. Mostly I ride bikes either
    recreationally or as a way to commute to work or on other errands.
    I like to go on hikes and I try camping at least once a year.
    I play football regularily and sometime I've lifted weights at a gym.
    In the summer of 2012 my friend and I went on a 2 month biking tour
    through Europe, visiting six countries and bicycling over 1600 km.}
\cvitem{chess}{For many years I studied chess and I achieved a peak
    ELO rating of 2062. In 2007 I became national champion U20 and
    in 2009 I played in the World Youth Chess Championship held in
    Antalya, Turkey. Twice I became Nordic champion and three times
    national champion with my junior college chess team. I have
    taught chess in various elementary schools and organized my own
    summer chess workshops.}
\cvitem{math}{I am deeply intrigued by the concept of infinity
    and I take joy in intuitive proofs by contradiction. During
    junior college I participated in multiple mathematics competitions
    and twice I was selected to compete with the national team in
    Baltic Way.}
\cvitem{tech}{Previous hands-on hobby projects included autonomous
    Raspberry Pis hosting websites and recording timelapses. Set
    up \url{blog.bjk.is} to document some of it. I manage my own VPS
    hosting websites and experimenting with various webservices.}
