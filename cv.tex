\section{Work experience}
\cventry{2019 -- \emph{curr.}}{Senior DevOps Consultant}{Opsdis}{Stockholm}{Sweden}
{Projects include: Visualising Mobility-as-a-Service data using Prometheus and Grafana.
Alerting based on predictive metrics using statistical models in Scikit (Python). 
Diff-based syncing of hardware infrastructure into Nagios-based monitoring systems
using HTTP APIs.}
\cventry{2015 -- 2017\\2018}{Software Developer}{WuXi NextCODE}{Reykjavik}{Iceland}
{Started off in DevOps like assignments of maintaining, executing and
further developing deployment (Chef, Ansible) and infrastructure (AWS
CloudFormation, Terraform) code. Handed it over to a newly created Backend
Group and joined the Data Group. Developed Python code to import and process
genomic data in our system and integrating 3rd party platforms with ours.
Built, tested and deployed components in CI/CD loops using tools such as
Jenkins, Docker and Ansible. Spent the summer of 2018 creating a benchmarking suite
for the company's core software which runs in a CI loop to detect performance
regression.}
%~ \cventry{Summer 2015}{Software Developer}{Handpoint}{Kopavogur}{Iceland}
%~ {Implementing protocols with partners and developing card reader software.
%~ Didn't like it and quit.}
%~ \cventry{Summer 2014}{Software Developer}{Invector}{Reykjavik}{Iceland}
%~ {Developing a web app for clients using Invector's statistical model to estimate
%~ prices of real estates worldwide. Working primarily on designing the database,
%~ the user system and other backend programming.}
%~ \cventry{Summer 2013}{Software Developer}{Reykjavik Energy}{Reykjavik}{Iceland}
%~ {Brought in to program an interactive educational game about Reykjavik Energy's
%~ CarbFix project. Worked with three Master's students who designed the game and
%~ wrote the educational material. Coded the game in raw JavaScript using images
%~ and graphics drawn and provided by them.}
%~ \cventry{Summer 2013}{Web programming}{Reconesse}{Reykjavik}{}
%~ {Together with two other university students we developed an
%~ interactive educational game about interesting female role models in
%~ women's right history for their website. The project received a
%~ grant from Rannís' Icelandic Student Innovation Fund.}

President of the student union Stigull during the school year 2013-14. Wrote a
thesis named \emph{Occurrence graphs of patterns in permutations} (available from

%~ \section{Master thesis}
%~ \cvitem{title}{Searching for combinatorial covers using integer linear programming}
%~ \cvitem{supervisor}{Henning A. Ulfarsson, Assistant Professor at Reykjavik University \newline Christian Bean, Postdoctoral Researcher at Reykjavik University}
%~ \cvitem{abstract}{We introduce the \textsf{CombCov} framework which 
%~ is a generalization of the \textsf{Struct} algorithm introduced by 
%~ Bean, Gudmundsson, and Ulfarsson in 
%~ \emph{``Automatic discovery of structural rules of permutation classes''}. 
%~ We give a simple example of an application of the framework to 
%~ \emph{avoidance sets} of \emph{words} and discuss in detail how to 
%~ generate \emph{rules} of lesser complexity and how a cover is verified 
%~ up to a certain size using integer linear programming. We then apply the
%~ framework to various published results on \emph{permutations} avoiding 
%~ \emph{mesh patterns} and try to find covers of similar problems with 
%~ some success. We show that \textsf{CombCov} is a powerful tool in 
%~ guiding humans by coming up with conjectures that would otherwise 
%~ have required substantial effort to discover manually.}

%~ \section{Bachelor thesis}
%~ \cvitem{title}{Occurrence graphs of patterns in permutations}
%~ \cvitem{supervisor}{Henning A. Ulfarsson, Postdoctoral Researcher at Reykjavik University}
%~ \cvitem{abstract}{This paper is based on a generalization of the
%~ idea behind the proof of the \emph{Simultaneous Shading Lemma} by
%~ Claesson et al.\@ (2014). We define the \emph{occurrence graph}
%~ $G_p(\pi)$ of a pattern $p$ in a permutation $\pi$ as the graph with
%~ the occurrences of $p$ in $\pi$ as vertices and edges between the
%~ vertices if the occurrences differ by exactly one element. We study
%~ the general properties of the occurrence graphs and some interesting
%~ extreme cases. The main theorem in this paper is that every \emph
%~ {hereditary property} of graphs produces a \emph{permutation class}.}

    hosting websites and experimenting with various webservices.}
\cvitem{math}{I am deeply intrigued by the concept of infinity
    and I take joy in intuitive proofs by contradiction. During
    junior college I participated in multiple mathematics competitions
    and twice I was selected to compete with the national team in
    Baltic Way.}
\cvitem{chess}{For many years I studied chess and I achieved a peak
    ELO rating of 2062. In 2007 I became national champion U20 and
